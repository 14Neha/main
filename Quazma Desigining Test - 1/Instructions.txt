Create a HTML page using page.jpg mockup file. 

The HTML has to be pixel perfect and close to jpg file as much as possible.

Required resources are avaiable in resources folder, if anything missing, use dummy content.

For icons use dummy font awesome icons for now.

There are three sliders in the page, they should be live.

Use google's Noto Sans font family.
